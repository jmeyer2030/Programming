The code is the solution to the following problems. A pdf of the referenced textbook is in this file.

55. The  data  used  for  Figure  20.1  in  the  book  can  be  viewed  as  being  generated  by  
hypothesis  h5.  For  hypotheses  h3  and  h4,  generate  one  dataset  each  of  size  200  and  plot  
graphs for P(hi|d1,...dN), i=1,..,5, as N varies from 1 to 200. (You can use a mathematics 
package like R, Matlab  or Mathematica, or  general purpose languages like python to do 
this. Attach the code to your answer.)  

56. Continuing  with  the  above,  plot  graphs  for  P(DN+1=lime|d1,...dN)  as  N  varies  from  1  to  
200. Attach the code to your answer. 

57. Finally,  plot  P(DN+1=lime|hMAP)  and  P(DN+1=lime|hML)  as  N  varies  from  1  to  200.  Pick 
hMAP / hML just from h3 and h4 and assume the prior probability of h3 to be 0.9. Attach the 
code to your answer
